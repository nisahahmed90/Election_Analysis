# Election Analysis PyPoll

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of the election audit is to have an automated election vote counting system and determine if Python would be more well suited to determining election results over Excel. This particular precinct includes three counties and three candidates for the office. Python is being utilized to determine how well it automates the tasks of counting the votes, calculating percentages, and determining the winner of the election amongst other things.

## Election Audit Summary

Using Python and VS Code to automate the counting of votes and include voter turnout by county with candidate results has been a great way to reduce human error and do the election analysis. 

Now that we have the code ready we can use this for another csv file containing data for other counties and/or years. We would only have to import the relevant csv file and change modify the information in this step:

Also, the same code can be used for counting of votes at the state level by making slight modifications to the county variables used and using the relevant csv file.

In short, no matter the number of candidates or counties, the script used to perform the Election Audit can be a valuable resource for the board.
